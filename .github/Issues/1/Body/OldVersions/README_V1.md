### Upload error - October 2nd 2020 data uploaded to the wrong directory

I uploaded the October 2nd 2020 data to the wrong directory. I realized after I uploaded most of the files, and at that point, I decided to just continue uploading. To clarify, this was the October 2nd folder within the **September** 2020 directory. If anyone knows how to mass move binary files without deletion or individual uploads, it would be helpful to know.
