### [Upload error] Data for other game accidentally updated (January 6th 2021)

I accidentally uploaded Sky Burger data for 1 entry for January 6th 2021 by mistake. I was distracted while doing this. This folder needs deletion, but I don't know how to mass-delete files in Git, and I don't want to make 100 separate commits of deleting files if there is an easier way.
