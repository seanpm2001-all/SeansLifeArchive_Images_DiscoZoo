# December 30th 2020 Disco Zoo session

## What happened?

Today, I cut my session short, as I didn't have much interest in playing today to begin with. When I found I couldn't watch ads for more attempts on getting new animals in my zoo, I decided to make today a collect only day and quit early.

I am hoping this does not happen again next week, but something similar might happen if this pattern repeats on January 6th 2021.
